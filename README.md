Entropic Controller

An Entropic Controller consists of three parts:

1) A scanner to identify the particles within the Entropic Controller's cube of control
2) A computer to calculate injection vectors of particles to force the particles within the Entropic Controller's cube to a certain state
3) An injector to inject the particles to allow a transition from the scanned state to another defined state as calculated by the computer

This is software representing the computer component of the Entropic Controller.

This software is under development.
